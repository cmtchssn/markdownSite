While field recording in Yellowstone National Park, I discovered the difficulty of recording a natural landscape. Every recording I made had people walking, talking, and revving vehicle engines. I was trying to listen to nature, but couldn’t hear it over the sounds of people, myself included. I was under the impression that by going into the wild, I could escape the sounds of civilization. The ironic outcome of my field recordings led me to create *Re-Sounding Wild*.  
  
*Re-Sounding Wild* is a piece of driftwood with embedded electronics for interactivity. From the wood comes audible bits of a natural soundscape to entice participants to examine the installation. As participants get closer, however, the natural soundscape changes to a soundscape of civilization. All of the recordings are from Yellowstone National Park. The few sounds of nature include rivers, streams, geysers, and birds. The many sounds of civilization include footsteps, families taking photos, people discussing trail routes, talk of bear sightings, international tourists, vehicles, and a father scolding his son. *Re-Sounding Wild* is a demonstration of the natural soundscapes of national parks.  
  
*Re-Sounding Wild* is an installation made with Raspberry Pi 3 Model B, pHAT BEAT, Arduino UNO, distance sensors, transducers, and driftwood. The transducers are attached directly to the driftwood to actuate the wood’s resonant frequencies. It uses Pure Data to control and playback audio, and uses Firmata for the distance sensors to communicate with Pure Data.
